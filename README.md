# lichess-rs
collection of lichess APIs & clis in rust:

- `liboard` is the interactive TUI for all things lichess
- `lichess-board` is a high level API for playing lichess games
- `lichess-bot` is a high level API for playing lichess games with a bot
- `lichess-client` is a low level API for interacting with the v2 lichess API

Currently only `liboard`, `lichess-board`, and `lichess-client` are being developed in accordance with [`lichess-minecraft`](https://github.com/LeoDog896/lichess-minecraft).
